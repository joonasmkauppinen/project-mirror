### A project to support the life management of young men at risk of exclusion
Artificial intelligence coupled with the real needs and interests of young men, we find targeted new opportunities for the future that are tailored to the individual.

### Multidisciplinary Outputs
Young men play an important role in a multidisciplinary team, representing the target group at the heart of development work. Their job is to identify different user needs and make their voice heard in the Young Men project.

### The expert team built by Metropolia University of Applied Sciences consists of:
* artificial intelligence technology
* Health Promotion
* Social Services
* service design

### Mobile artificial intelligence app
The aim of the project is to develop a mobile artificial intelligence application to tell young men new paths of the future that match their interests and the skills they have already acquired in life.

### Participating workshops
Young men aged 16-29 are sought through organizations and youth workshops are organized in youth facilities.

Six different youth organizations or organizations working with young people are being sought.

In January 2019, the first episode of Week 8 will begin at the Scene Association. The multidisciplinary project team joins forces with the young people in the target group to design and develop a Mirror activating model for young people.

In addition, the workshops will focus on defining the usability of the artificial intelligence application using easy prototype models and exploring what artificial intelligence in general means. Through technology, a young person becomes aware of his or her own life situation and opens new paths for the future in an unprecedented way.

### Young in the app controls
The Mirror Artificial Intelligence application created during the project enables independent data storage and recommends to the young person, based on the information provided by him / her, the study and work places and networks to which the young person can join. This application can be used by people working with young people to activate young people to manage their own knowledge and life situation.

### Means of service design
Working together is emphasized in achieving a common goal.

The project uses service design methods to glue a multidisciplinary development team together when designing a service. Service design through various experiments creates a PEILI development model for multidisciplinary teams.

The development model breaks sectoral silos by involving members of the development team, irrespective of substance, to some extent in all stages of development. Internal communication is emphasized in an effort to gain a common understanding of the goals of doing so. In practice, this means breaking down terminology, working with technology experts on a weekly basis alongside social and health promotion and vice versa.

The target group is at the heart of continuous iterative development work.
